Me
======

Hi, I'm Stephan and I'm currently a final year BSc Computer Science student at the University of Sheffield.

I grew up in Santpoort-Noord and lived here until I moved to Sheffield. This is where I completed highschool (VWO) and commuted to Delft from for a BSc Aerospace Engineering for a year. During this time I was also very active in the [local lifeguard](http://www.ijrb.nl).

Matchchat
-------

In my first year at university I set up the company Matchchat together with 3 others students: George Bettany, James Routledge and Nabil Freeman. I mainly worked on the back-end of any development while Nabil worked on the front end and design. This became a full-time job during my second year as we were accepted into [ignite100](http://ignite.io/#accelerator). I parted ways a year later to finish my degree.

During this my main roll was to to make all the products we made throughout the year work. Making sure the systems kept running and keeping up with the fluctuating demand that comes along with being a startup, dealing with the data we gathered, making that data suitable for our needs and setting up and maintaining the working environment for Nabil, me and later other developers.

Interests
=======

There are a bunch of things I am passionate about but they boil down to 2 main areas: coding and water. Also some stray stuff that doesn't fit in.

Coding
------

Coding has always intrigued me, from the start when I got access to a computer I always tried to (and usually succeeded) to make it do what I wanted it to do.

First and foremost my passion in development lies in the web sector. This is currently the fastest growing area in coding, webapps allows for rapid prototyping and development. Not all projects are suitable for this type of environment but a lot are and if you are willing to dig a little bit deeper into the tools you are developing with the power you have available to you rivals a lot of other environments.

To this end I know a lot of programming languages and supporting tools: PHP, MySQL, Apache, NodeJS, JS, HTML, CSS and much more.

For other projects where web isn't an appropriate tool I have a good knowledge of Java, have a working knowledge of C++/C and I'm currently working on improving this.

None of these things would be any use without a platform to run it on. I have familiarized myself with both linux and windows administration. I'm far better with linux but will manage capably with both. From this combined with my web experiences a deep interest has formed for the security behind all this. From social engineering all the way down to cryptography and everything in between.

Sadly most of the projects I have worked on in the past are either no longer exist, badly aged, too custom, proprietary or a combination of all of these.

Water
------
Most things in, around or on the water will get my interest. As mentioned before I was very active in the [local lifeguard](http://www.ijrb.nl), this has severely reduced since I moved to Sheffield but I still help out when I can. I've been swimming from a young age and have always kept this up. Sailing has also kept my interest but this didn't have the chances to develop as much as lifeguarding and later scuba diving.

I'm currently certified as a BSAC Sports Diver through the [Sheffield University SAC](http://www.susac.com). I've been doing this since I moved to Sheffield and enjoyed it from day 1.

Other
------

Other than that while I was a student in Delft I was a part of [DARE](http://dare.tudelft.nl). DARE is a student amateur rocketry society. During my time there I was involved in 2 small rocket project teams and over the summer in the CanSat team.

In Sheffield I am currently very active in the University gaming society as head tech, leading the team that makes the LAN events happen and maintain the society servers. I also train the others in the teams so they are up to taking over once I leave at the end of the year.

While I haven't had much time for it lately a last thing to mention here is music. I play the piano when I can find the time and currently have an Oxygen88 midi controller to do so. I'm looking forward to getting back to how good I used to be once I have more time free to invest in this.
