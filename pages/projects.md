Projects
=======

Sadly as noted in [Me](me) most of the projects I've worked on either no longer exist, aged badly, are way too custom or are proprietary. There are still a few that I will highlight. (more to come)

[This website](https://github.com/stephanbroek/site) - This for one was put together in about an afternoon using PHP, composer, smarty and a markdown compiler. The main thought behind it is that all pages are written in markdown and compiled on the fly to HTML.
